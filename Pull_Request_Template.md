            - [ ] in combination with bucket tool filles a complete area with the chosen colour (be sure to have closed the contour line ;) Otherwise, the undo button will be your friend ;)
            - [ ] updates length and volume information (of what has been segmented) in the upper left corner of the viewer
        * erase tool
            - [ ] erases upon click drag from the annotation

        * ruler tool
            - [ ] measures the distance between start and end of your defined path
                - [ ] points of mouse click appear and stay visible until you hit return key (this functionality is currently broken!) (you can click as many points as you wish to define the path you are interested in)
                - [ ] on return key, BrainBox will print the distance into the chat field (the ruler tool seems to be currently broken!!!)
